## Description

Application used to track employee's roles, departments, how much an employee normally makes in that department, and who that employee's manager is. There's also functions to add new departments, employees, and roles. In the future would like to add functions for deleting roles, departments, and employees. Also a function to view employees by their manager's id number.

## Installation

Run npm i after copying the repository over.

## Usage

Great for keeping track of employees, how much that they make, and what department they work in.
